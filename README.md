# Description :house:

## Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is a significant step towards building a comprehensive web application, emulating the functionalities of AirBnB. This initial phase involves creating a command interpreter to manage various AirBnB objects, laying the foundation for future developments including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end implementation.

### Project Overview

The project encompasses the following key objectives:
1. __Command Interpreter:__
   + Develop a command interpreter similar to a shell but tailored to manage AirBnB objects.
   + Facilitate operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.
2. __BaseModel Class:__
   + Implement a parent class, BaseModel, to handle the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
   + Ensure a smooth serialization/deserialization flow: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
3. __Object Classes:__
   + Create various classes for AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel.
4. __Storage Engine:__
   + Develop an abstracted storage engine for the project, starting with file storage.
5. __Unit Testing:__
   + Implement unittests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.

### Command Interpreter

The command interpreter serves as a management tool for the project's objects, akin to a shell but focused on specific tasks:
+ __Create Objects:__ Instantiate new objects (e.g., a new User or a new Place).
+ __Retrieve Objects:__ Fetch objects from files, databases, etc.
+ __Operate on Objects:__ Perform operations such as counting and computing statistics on objects.
+ __Update Objects:__ Modify the attributes of existing objects.
+ __Destroy Objects:__ Delete objects from the system.

### Steps and Componenets

1. __Initialization:__
   + Establish the BaseModel class for initialization and serialization/deserialization of instances.
2. __Serialization/Deserialization Flow:__
   + Create a smooth flow for converting instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and storing them in files.
3. __Class Inheritance:__
   + Develop all necessary classes for the AirBnB objects, ensuring they inherit from BaseModel.
4. __Storage Engine Implementation:__
   + Begin with a file storage engine to handle object persistence.
5. __Testing:__
   + Create comprehensive unittests to ensure the robustness and reliability of all components.

### Future Developments

This initial phase is crucial as it sets the stage for subsequent projects that will build upon this foundation. Future tasks will involve:
- __HTML/CSS Templating:__ Designing the front-end interface.
- __Database Storage:__ Implementing database storage for better scalability.
- __API Integration:__ Creating APIs for enhanced functionality and connectivity.
- __Front-end Integeration:__ Integrating the front-end with the back-end to deliver a complete web application.
